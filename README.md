I used a 1-D array to store the photo,and the coordinates was saved to a an array called coords.
It was simpler to me to with the 1D rather than 2D.
Null is returned only if photo is empty,length as strings=0,threshold<0,team>10 or<0.

There is a Main class with the project case you want to test the program as a whole.
